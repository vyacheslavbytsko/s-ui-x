# Changelog (English)

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This is the English-language changelog. See `CHANGELOG-RU.md` for Russian and
`CHANGELOG-ZH.md` for Simplified Chinese.

## [1.5.6-beta1] - 2026-05-27 - sing-box 1.13 UI parity beta

- Adds first-class UI coverage for sing-box 1.13 TLS advanced options,
  including curve preferences, client authentication/certificates,
  certificate public key pins and outbound kTLS controls.
- Fixes route/DNS rule interface-address wire shapes and adds network/Wi-Fi
  state matchers across route rules, DNS rules and inline/source headless
  rule-set rules.
- Adds inline rule-set editing, route `bypass` option serialization, route
  reject `reply`, Naive receive windows/UoT version selection, TUN reset
  mark/NFQUEUE, Tailscale advertise tags, OCM/CCM headers and the
  `oom-killer` service UI/backend registration.
- Adds representative sing-box 1.13 option-unmarshal coverage plus an OOM
  service registry regression test.
- Validation: `npm --prefix frontend run build`, `npm --prefix frontend run
  test`, `npm --prefix frontend run lint`, and `go test -tags
  "with_quic,with_grpc,with_utls,with_acme,with_gvisor,with_naive_outbound,with_purego,with_tailscale"
  ./...` passed locally.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-05-26 - stable 1.5.5 release

- Promotes `v1.5.5-beta1` through `v1.5.5-beta4-hotfix2` to stable `v1.5.5`.
- Fixes subscription correctness for shared VLESS UUIDs and Clash WebSocket
  Host headers: `xtls-rprx-vision` is stripped from non-TCP transports, and
  Clash/Mihomo exports keep a usable `ws-opts.headers.Host`.
- Hardens backup export, restore and import rollback. The no-TLS `tls.id=0`
  sentinel is preserved safely, failed imports reopen the live DB,
  `settings.config` carries DNS/routing restore coverage, and backup export no
  longer lets the sentinel collide with real TLS rows.
- Carries the beta4 security/reliability work: forced password reset for
  imported administrators, safer token handling, audit prioritization, streamed
  large X-UI import plans, rollback realtime invalidation, configurable SQLite
  pools, fail-closed IP-monitor reads, bounded rate-limit state, realtime
  self-healing, retry/backoff improvements and data-race fixes.
- Includes frontend hotfixes for the npm lockfile, Playwright/Vite e2e
  stability, reconnect chaos tests and accessibility baseline timeout.
- Updates Go to `1.26.3`, `github.com/sagernet/sing-box` to `v1.13.12`, and
  synchronizes the cronet-go source pin used by release/Docker builds.
- Validation: `go vet ./...`, `go test -race -timeout=10m ./...`, release-tag
  `go build`, and `git diff --check` passed locally. Docker was not available
  in the local workspace; GitHub release/Docker workflows run on tag push.

## [1.5.5-beta4-hotfix2] - 2026-05-26 - backup export TLS sentinel hotfix

- **Backup export with real TLS rows.**
  Problem: the no-TLS sentinel row `tls.id=0` was copied through GORM's normal
  auto-increment create path. When a database also had a real TLS row, SQLite
  could assign the sentinel a generated id and the next real row copy failed
  with `UNIQUE constraint failed: tls.id`.
  Impact: backup export now skips `tls.id=0` during the generic table copy and
  restores that sentinel explicitly with `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so no-TLS inbounds
  keep a valid parent row without colliding with real TLS configs.
- Added regression coverage for a database that contains both `tls.id=0` and a
  regular TLS row.
- Updated release metadata, README install examples and manual workflow default
  tags to `v1.5.5-beta4-hotfix2`.

## [1.5.5-beta4] - 2026-05-26 - problem-fix and technical-debt report

### 1. Security, Authentication And Audit

- **Forced password reset during import.**
  Problem: the UI offered `reset_required` when migrating administrators from
  x-ui, but the backend did not have a durable state for mandatory password
  reset and fell back to the generated-password scenario.
  Impact: users now have `force_password_reset` state, the API contract matches
  the UI, and this import mode no longer generates or exposes a temporary
  password in the import report.
- **Token attack resistance and legacy header sunset.**
  Problem: WebSocket token checks had measurable timing differences, the legacy
  `Token` authorization header had no enforced cutoff date, and legacy API token
  migration could re-enable previously disabled tokens.
  Impact: WebSocket token consumption uses a safer match-and-delete path, the
  legacy `Token` header is rejected after Sunset, and token migration preserves
  the original enabled/disabled state.
- **System-data leak reduction.**
  Problem: system information could expose private and link-local server
  addresses, Telegram backup secrets needed clearer memory ownership, and
  generated administrator passwords in MigrateXui were too easy to reveal on
  screen.
  Impact: internal addresses are filtered from system info, Telegram backup
  payloads and passphrases are zeroed after use, and generated administrator
  passwords stay hidden until explicit reveal and are cleared automatically.
- **Audit priority and signal quality.**
  Problem: under audit queue pressure, warn/security events could be evicted by
  ordinary `info` events; successful legacy secret decrypts created noisy audit
  records; stats commit failures lacked a durable trail; and optional URL
  settings accepted control characters.
  Impact: the audit writer preserves warning/security priority, redundant
  secretbox fallback noise is removed, stats commit failures are recorded, and
  optional URL settings reject control characters and unsafe input shapes.

### 2. X-UI Import, Sync And Admin UI

- **Respecting saved import policy.**
  Problem: background X-UI sync used hard-coded behavior and could ignore saved
  profile fields such as `OnlyNew`, settings/history/routing import and
  administrator handling mode.
  Impact: the scheduler now passes the saved import policy into planning and
  apply, so cron sync follows the administrator's profile settings.
- **Large import handling.**
  Problem: migration plans were read as ordinary multipart fields with an 8 MiB
  limit, which blocked larger panels from using the same apply contract, and
  interrupted uploads could leave temporary directories behind.
  Impact: the multipart `plan` field streams through temporary storage under
  the 200 MiB request cap, and stale `xui-import-*` temporary directories are
  cleaned up by a safe age-based rule.
- **Import isolation and report accuracy.**
  Problem: TLS delete errors in replace mode could be ignored before creating
  replacement records, and skipped WireGuard endpoints were counted as skipped
  inbounds.
  Impact: TLS delete errors abort the transaction and roll back safely, while
  import reports now count skipped endpoints separately.
- **Rollback and recovery UX.**
  Problem: apply errors could send the user back a step without useful context,
  rollback waited a fixed one-second delay before reload, and other active
  sessions were not notified about restored configuration state.
  Impact: MigrateXui shows apply errors inline, rollback waits for a health
  check before reload, and the backend publishes `config_invalidated` after a
  successful rollback.

### 3. Database, Backup And Resilience

- **Backup and migration safety.**
  Problem: SIGHUP timeout was fixed at three seconds, WAL checkpoint failures
  could abort backup on a locked SQLite database, missing `settings.config`
  blocked versioned restore, and post-migration adapt failures were only logged
  as warnings.
  Impact: timeout is environment-configurable, WAL checkpoint falls back from
  `TRUNCATE` to `FULL`, backups without `settings.config` restore with a
  warning, and broken post-migration adapt now stops startup.
- **Database scaling and first-start races.**
  Problem: SQLite pool limits were fixed, and concurrent first-start paths could
  create duplicate default settings.
  Impact: SQLite pool limits can be tuned through environment variables, and
  default settings are created through a database-level idempotent insert path.
- **IP monitor fail-closed behavior.**
  Problem: a transient database read error in the IP-monitor path could allow an
  unknown address in enforce mode.
  Impact: failed `client_ips` reads mark the cache entry as unreliable and move
  enforcement to fail-closed behavior.

### 4. Network, Data Races And Core Stability

- **OOM protection and realtime self-healing.**
  Problem: import-xui rate-limit state could grow without a hard bound under a
  stream of unique IPs, and the frontend could remain in degraded polling mode
  after a short network outage.
  Impact: the rate-limit cache now uses bounded eviction and expired-bucket
  cleanup, while the WebSocket runtime attempts healing reconnects from
  fallback mode.
- **Data race fixes.**
  Problem: concurrent access to core restart timers, the Telegram HTTP client
  and token-use flushing could trigger race detector failures, panics or writes
  through an outdated database handle.
  Impact: critical paths are protected with mutex, single-flight and barrier
  mechanisms, and token-use flush lifecycle is synchronized with database reset
  and API test lifecycle.
- **Smarter retries and storm protection.**
  Problem: cron sync retried too aggressively, token-use write failures lacked a
  backoff circuit, update checks called GitHub without ETag caching, sync error
  reasons were flattened, and WARP authorization headers were spread across
  fragile code paths.
  Impact: retry policies use exponential backoff, token-use flushing has a
  circuit breaker, release checks use `If-None-Match`, sync-failure summaries
  include sanitized error class/detail, and WARP authorized headers are
  centralized.
- **IPv6-safe system info and shared API route registry.**
  Problem: system info could panic on short interface flag/address data,
  including unusual IPv6-only environments, and import-xui routes could drift
  between v1 and v2 API registration.
  Impact: network interfaces are checked by content and length, and import-xui
  endpoints are registered from one route spec for `/api` and `/apiv2`.

## [1.5.5-beta3] - 2026-05-22 - backup config restore safety for DNS and routing

- Config saves now recreate a missing `settings.config` row, and restore rejects
  versioned S-UI database backups that already lost that sing-box config instead
  of accepting an import without DNS and routing rules.
- Added restore coverage that exports and reimports `settings.config` with DNS
  servers and routing rules intact.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.5-beta3`.

## [1.5.5-beta2] - 2026-05-22 - backup restore safety for no-TLS inbounds

- Kept backup exports with no-TLS inbounds foreign-key valid by explicitly
  preserving the `tls(id=0)` sentinel that their `tls_id=0` rows reference.
- Restore now recreates that no-TLS foreign-key parent before migration checks,
  so backups produced before this prerelease can restore instead of failing
  with `Foreign key check failed: inbounds=1`.
- Failed database imports reopen the rolled-back live database instead of
  leaving the running panel with a closed DB handle; SQLite sessions follow
  the live DB after swap and settings reads fail cleanly if the DB is
  temporarily unavailable.
- Added regression coverage for no-TLS backup FK validity, no-TLS migration
  repair and rollback/reopen after a rejected restore.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.5-beta2`.

## [1.5.5-beta1] - 2026-05-22 - subscription correctness for shared VLESS UUID and Clash WS Host

- Stripped `xtls-rprx-vision` flow from non-TCP transports when the same
  client UUID is shared across multiple VLESS inbounds. Affects panel
  sing-box config (`fetchUsersByCondition`), JSON subscription
  (`sub/jsonService.go`) and shareable links (`vlessLink`). Aligns with
  Xray-core's TCP-only flow contract so a TCP+REALITY inbound and a
  gRPC+TLS (or WS) inbound can serve the same UUID without breaking the
  non-TCP one (alireza0/s-ui#1127).
- Fixed Clash `ws-opts.headers` so the WebSocket `Host` header is
  emitted again. The previous `[]interface{}` cast against a
  map-shaped header silently dropped it, causing Mihomo handshake
  failures through strict CDN / Nginx upstreams. The exporter also
  falls back to TLS `server_name` when no explicit Host is set so the
  upstream always sees a Host that matches the SNI
  (alireza0/s-ui#1126).
- Added regression coverage in `service/inbounds_vless_flow_test.go`,
  `util/genLink_vless_flow_test.go` and `sub/clashService_ws_host_test.go`.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.5-beta1`.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-05-22 - stable Nexus UI line + localization cleanup

- Promoted `1.5.4-beta1` through `1.5.4-beta5` to stable `1.5.4`.
- Includes the opt-in Nexus UI mode, canceled read toast hotfix, denser Nexus
  Overview, systemd installer secretbox key bootstrap, and reserved `/ws` path
  boundary fix from the beta line.
- Finished the release localization pass: Persian Telegram, Audit, maintenance,
  backup and IP-limit strings; Vietnamese machine-translation cleanup across
  Telegram, Audit, settings, networking, DNS, TLS, rules and stats; remaining
  Simplified/Traditional Chinese maintenance path strings; and final Russian
  terminology polish.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target `v1.5.4`.

## [1.5.4-beta5] - 2026-05-22 - reserved path prefix hotfix

- Reserved path validation now matches slashless framework paths on a
  path-segment boundary instead of rejecting every string prefix match.
- Custom paths such as `/wsub/` no longer collide with the reserved
  `/ws` route, while `/ws`, `/ws/` and descendants under `/ws/` remain
  blocked.
- Added regression coverage for the `/ws` boundary behavior used by
  saved panel and subscription path settings.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.4-beta5`.

## [1.5.4-beta4] - 2026-05-22 - installer secretbox key bootstrap

- Systemd installs through `install.sh` now generate a stable
  `SUI_SECRETBOX_KEY` for encrypted settings when no installer-managed
  key exists yet.
- The generated secretbox key is shown once during installation, stored
  in root-only `/etc/s-ui/secretbox.env`, and loaded through an
  installer-owned systemd drop-in.
- Upgrade runs preserve the existing installer-managed key instead of
  rotating it; uninstall removes the drop-in with the rest of the
  systemd install state.
- Documented the installer-managed secretbox key path and retention
  requirement for systemd users.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.4-beta4`.

## [1.5.4-beta3] - 2026-05-22 - Nexus Overview density refinement

- Re-graded Nexus dark surfaces to a deeper navy palette with teal and
  violet accents while keeping classic themes unchanged.
- Removed the standalone Traffic overview panel and the duplicate Health
  KPI, keeping the Live traffic KPI spark on a compact live status sample
  window.
- Reflowed the Overview into a denser three-column primary row and
  compacted Top clients, Recent events and Protocol summaries so the
  dark LTR `en` dashboard fits one `1440x900` viewport.
- Kept the refinement frontend-only: no backend/API/CSRF/CSP drift and no
  runtime or development dependency changes.
- Verified frontend test/lint/build gates, Nexus source/build artifact
  external-origin gates, `TestAdminSecurityHeaders`, and LTR `en` plus
  RTL `fa` viewport coverage across desktop, narrow desktop, tablet and
  mobile widths.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.4-beta3`.

## [1.5.4-beta2] - 2026-05-21 - Nexus overview cancel toast hotfix

- Suppressed the failed notification for canceled duplicate frontend
  reads. Nexus Overview can trigger overlapping dashboard reads during
  startup, and the shared axios dedupe path intentionally cancels the
  older request; this is now kept silent instead of surfacing
  `CanceledError: canceled` as a user-visible toast.
- Added frontend regression coverage for silent cancellations while
  keeping failed notifications for real request errors.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.4-beta2`.

## [1.5.4-beta1] - 2026-05-21 - Nexus UI mode opt-in beta

- Added the opt-in `nexus` UI mode alongside the existing `classic`
  interface. Classic remains the default and Nexus is a per-browser
  localStorage preference.
- Added the UI mode contract, `VITE_ENABLE_NEXUS` kill switch,
  CSP-safe pre-mount anti-FOUC bootstrap, authenticated layout host,
  mode controls and localized Nexus strings.
- Added the Nexus shell, responsive sidebar/topbar behavior, RTL `fa`
  support, Nexus design tokens/themes and the fixed Nexus Overview
  dashboard built from existing data sources.
- Preserved the backend/API/CSRF/CSP surface: no new endpoints, no new
  WebSocket flow, no inline scripts, no external-origin Nexus source
  literals and no runtime/dev dependency changes.
- Verified the final beta with `npm run test`, `npm run lint`,
  `npm run build`, external-origin gates, supply-chain invariance and
  Nexus viewport checks for LTR `en` and RTL `fa` at desktop, narrow
  desktop, tablet and mobile widths.
- Release, Windows and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.4-beta1`.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-05-21 - stable release + Telegram backup schedule UX

- Promoted the release line from `1.5.3-beta` to stable `1.5.3`.
- Telegram database backup scheduling is now configured through friendly
  presets and custom minute/hour intervals while continuing to store the
  existing `telegramBackupCron` setting.
- Existing custom cron expressions remain supported through Advanced cron mode.
- Release, Windows, and Docker workflow dispatch defaults now target
  `v1.5.3`.

## [1.5.3-beta] - 2026-05-20 - aggregated remediation + upstream parity (#1114)

### Multi-chat delivery ledger (P0-P5)

#### Security

- [P0] Hardened SSRF filtering and dial-time validation; tightened backup
  restore path/symlink checks.
- [P1] Hardened CSRF/session lifecycle behavior, including token renewal after
  logout/logout-all and tighter WS token handling.
- [P2] Expanded secret/settings safety checks and migration guardrails.
- [P3] Added listen fallback auditing and restart-path consistency hardening.

#### Reliability / data integrity

- [P0] Closed race-condition paths in tracker/session options/audit writer code.
- [P1] Stabilized realtime fallback behavior and frontend unit-test harness.
- [P2] Added reset hooks, tracker wait guards, and foreign-key migration checks.
- [P3] Unified restart scheduling and reduced global side effects with an
  initial DI slice.
- [P4] Moved the remaining service runtime globals behind a DI-compatible
  runtime while preserving zero-value service compatibility.
- [P5] Completed the logging backend cleanup without changing API endpoint
  behavior.

#### API and runtime behavior

- [P0] Improved trusted-proxy handling and safer import error classification.
- [P1] Tightened realtime/session/CSRF flows and Telegram error taxonomy.
- [P2] Normalized batching and timeout behavior in heavy data paths.
- [P3] Added an initial slog adapter path for gradual migration from
  go-logging.
- [P4] Promoted `slog` to the logger facade, leaving `op/go-logging` isolated
  behind deprecated compatibility APIs.
- [P5] Removed deprecated `logger.InitLogger`/`logger.GetLogger`, moved facade
  output fully onto standard `log/slog`, and kept panel/core log buffering.
- [P5] Removed the legacy `github.com/op/go-logging` module from `go.mod` and
  `go.sum`.
- [P4] Added a checked sing-box tracker revalidation policy for
  `github.com/sagernet/sing-box v1.13.11`.
- [P4] Added a checked SemVer release/version policy and prevented migration
  code from downgrading future `settings.version` values.

#### Frontend

- [P1] Fixed Vitest harness configuration in `frontend/vitest.config.ts`.
- [P1/P2] Aligned CSRF cache clearing, request dedupe boundaries, and realtime
  degraded-mode behavior.

#### Tests and verification

- Baseline and phase reports:
  - `plans/lint-baseline.txt`
  - `plans/lint-baseline-normalized.txt`
  - `plans/fix-validation.txt` (P0)
  - `plans/p1-validation.txt` (P1)
  - `plans/p2-validation.txt` (P2)
  - `plans/p3-architecture-validation.txt` (P3)
  - `plans/p4-architecture-debt-validation.txt` (P4)
  - `plans/p5-logging-cleanup-validation.txt` (P5)
- Each phase includes targeted checks and a final command pass set in its
  validation artifact.

### Traceability (multi-chat policy)

- Prefix each completed item with a phase tag: `[P0]`, `[P1]`, `[P2]`, `[P3]`, `[P4]`, `[P5]`.
- Add references in this format: `(ref: <commit|PR|chat-id>)`.
- Use combined tags for cross-phase items, for example `[P1/P2]`.
- Keep deferred architecture items in a separate section and do not mix them
  into completed bullets.

### Upgrade notes (aggregate window)

- Treat P0->P5 as one release window; create a full SQLite backup before
  upgrade.
- Validate behavior changes around session/CSRF/realtime and listen fallback in
  staging before production rollout.
- Use the phase validation files above as upgrade verification evidence.
- External Go integrations that imported `logger.InitLogger` or
  `logger.GetLogger` must migrate to `logger.Init(logger.Level*)`,
  `logger.Slog(source)`, or `slog.Default()`.

### Rollback (aggregate window)

- Restore the pre-window SQLite snapshot and previous binary/image.
- If rollback crosses session/token behavior changes, invalidate active sessions
  after downgrade and rotate admin credentials.

### Deferred architecture debt

- [P5] No P5 scope item is deferred. The legacy `op/go-logging` dependency and
  deprecated logger compatibility APIs have been removed.

### Reusable template for next multi-chat release

- Use domain sections: Security, Reliability/Data integrity, API/Runtime,
  Frontend, Tests.
- Tag each bullet with phase marker(s) and append traceability refs.
- Add explicit `Upgrade notes` and `Rollback` for the full aggregated window.

### Fixed

- TUIC subscription/share links and Clash export now include `udp_relay_mode`,
  preserving the configured value and defaulting generated links to `quic`
  when it is absent.

### Added

- Scheduled and manual encrypted SQLite database backup to Telegram. The backup
  passphrase is configured only in the Telegram tab, and the feature is off by
  default. New settings and defaults: `telegramBackupEnabled="false"`,
  `telegramBackupPassphrase=""`, `telegramBackupCron=""`,
  `telegramBackupExcludeTables="stats,client_ips,audit_events,changes"`, and
  `telegramBackupMaxSizeMB="45"`. New manual trigger routes:
  `POST /api/telegram/backup/run` and `POST /apiv2/telegram/backup/run`.
- Restore now auto-detects uploaded `SUI-TGBKP\x00` backup envelopes and shows
  a Backup passphrase field in Backup & Restore. Plaintext `.db` uploads are
  still accepted without that field.
- The existing Backup button can optionally download the same encrypted
  envelope via checkbox "Encrypt with Telegram backup passphrase". The checkbox
  is unchecked by default, plaintext download behavior is preserved, and the
  existing `getdb` endpoint uses the new non-breaking query parameter
  `encryptTelegramBackup=true`.
- The main release binary now includes `s-ui decrypt-backup` for offline
  envelope decryption. No separate artifact is required.
- `docs/scope-matrix.md` now documents the `tg_backup_run` operation.

### Changed

- BREAKING: legacy `POST /api/telegram/backup` and
  `POST /apiv2/telegram/backup` now delegate to the new Telegram backup
  service. `backupKey` is removed from every response,
  `telegramBackupEnabled=true` is required, and successful responses include
  `trigger="manual"`. There is no compatibility window. Strict migration step:
  after upgrading, enable `telegramBackupEnabled` in the Telegram tab; otherwise
  the legacy call returns HTTP 503 with `errorClass=disabled`.
- `util/secretbox` now has `EncryptBytes` and `DecryptBytes` helpers for
  byte-oriented secret handling.
- `api/rateLimit.go` has a shared manual Telegram backup bucket for all four
  manual trigger routes: 3 attempts per 60 seconds with `Retry-After`.
- New audit event types: `tg_backup_sent`, `tg_backup_failed`,
  `tg_backup_passphrase_changed`, `tg_backup_manual_encrypted`, and
  `tg_backup_restore_failed`.

### Upgrade notes

- Back up the SQLite database before upgrading. If using the system service,
  stop `s-ui`, copy `s-ui.db` plus any `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars, then start the
  service again.
- Telegram database backup remains disabled until `telegramBackupEnabled` is
  turned on in the Telegram tab and a Backup passphrase is configured.
- Existing integrations that call the legacy Telegram backup endpoints must
  handle the removed `backupKey` field and the new HTTP 503 `disabled` response
  until the setting is enabled.

### Rollback

- Restore the pre-upgrade SQLite backup and previous binary/image if rollback
  is required.
- Encrypted `.db.aes` files remain decryptable with the passphrase that created
  them via any binary containing `s-ui decrypt-backup`.

## [1.5.2-beta-hotfix2] - 2026-05-18 - drop legacy client_ips unique index

### Fixed

- `UNIQUE constraint failed: client_ips.client_name, client_ips.ip` during
  the 3x-ui pre-import auto-backup. `client_ips.ip` is a legacy column
  kept only for backfill since 1.5.x and is empty for new rows; the
  canonical unique key is `(client_name, ip_hash)`. The model still
  carried an obsolete `gorm:"index:idx_client_ips_client_ip,unique"`
  on `(client_name, ip)`, so `database/backup.go` re-created the bad
  index in the temporary backup DB via `AutoMigrate` and the chunked
  copy of `client_ips` failed as soon as one client owned more than
  one row with empty `ip`. After this hotfix the only unique index on
  the model is `(client_name, ip_hash)`.

### Changed

- `database/model/model.go` — removed the legacy
  `idx_client_ips_client_ip,unique` tag from `ClientIP.ClientName` and
  `ClientIP.IP`.
- `cmd/migration/1_5.go` — the `1.5` schema migration drops the legacy
  `idx_client_ips_client_ip` and creates a partial non-unique
  `idx_client_ips_client_legacy_ip ON client_ips(client_name, ip)
  WHERE ip IS NOT NULL AND ip != ''` for fast legacy lookups. The
  migration is fully idempotent (`DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` /
  `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`), so installs already on
  `1.5.2-beta` re-run it cleanly when the runner re-enters the `1.5`
  branch on the next start.
- `database/db.go: ensureIndexes` — drops the obsolete unique index at
  every `InitDB`. This is a runtime safety net for installs that
  bypass `MigrateDb` (for example, restoring an older backup outside
  the panel) and ensures the temporary backup DB built by `GetDb("")`
  no longer carries the bad index either.

### Notes

- No new columns, tables, settings, endpoints, scopes or environment
  variables. Combine with the previous hotfix's chunked-backup helpers.
- Regression coverage:
  - `cmd/migration/migration_1_5_test.go` proves the obsolete index is
    no longer created and accepts multiple empty-`ip` rows for one
    client.
  - `database/db_test.go: TestInitDBDropsObsoleteClientIPUniqueIndex`
    boots an old-shape DB with the legacy unique index already in
    place and verifies `InitDB` removes it.
  - `database/backup_test.go: TestGetDbHandlesHashedClientIPsWithEmptyLegacyIP`
    rounds-trips multiple `ip_hash` rows with empty `ip` for the same
    client through `GetDb("")`.

## [1.5.2-beta-hotfix] - 2026-05-18 - backup chunking and SPA upgrade safety

### Fixed

- `too many SQL variables` during database backup and 3x-ui migration on
  installs with large `stats`, `client_ips`, `audit_events`, `changes` or
  `clients` tables. The backup routine in `database/backup.go` no longer
  emits a single multi-row `INSERT VALUES (...)` that exceeded SQLite's
  compile-time variable limit (`SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER = 999` in
  `mattn/go-sqlite3`). This unblocks `WritePreImportBackup` and the
  3x-ui migration on production-sized databases (≈40k+ rows in `stats`).
- Stale `index.html` after upgrade no longer breaks the Clients tab.
  `/<base>/assets/*` now returns a real 404 for missing files instead of
  falling through to the SPA fallback, so browsers stop receiving
  `text/html` for JS module requests
  (`Failed to load module script` / `Failed to fetch dynamically imported
  module`). `index.html` is served with `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store,
  must-revalidate`; hashed assets keep `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
- The Vue Router now listens for `vite:preloadError` and triggers one
  guarded `window.location.reload()` (a `sessionStorage` flag prevents
  reload loops), so tabs left over from the previous build pick up the
  new bundle automatically.
- `service/client.go` (`addbulk`, `editbulk`, `ResetClients`,
  `DepleteClients`) and `database/importxui/history_routing.go` (historical
  traffic import) now chunk their bulk `Save`/`Create` calls through new
  `database/bulk.go` helpers (`SafeSQLiteBatchSize`, `CreateInBatchesSafe`,
  `SaveInBatchesSafe`). Reset/deplete jobs and historical-stats imports
  no longer fail on installs with thousands of clients.

### Notes

- No schema migrations, new endpoints, scopes or environment variables.
- A regression test (`database/backup_test.go`) now creates ≈43k `stats`
  rows plus 5k `client_ips` and verifies `GetDb("")` round-trips them.

## [1.5.2-beta] - 2026-05-18 - 3x-ui migration suite

### Added

- 3x-ui configuration import: `s-ui import-xui` CLI, `POST /api/import-xui`
  HTTP endpoint, and a "Migrate from 3x-ui" section in the Backup & Restore
  modal. Import runs in one transaction with auto-backup, supports
  `merge`/`replace`/`skip` strategies, and writes `xui_import` audit events.
- Full migration wizard at `/migrate-xui`: per-object plan/apply with
  `Source.Hash` validation, WebSocket `xui_import_progress` events, JSON
  preview, rollback to the auto-backup, and downloadable JSON/Markdown
  reports. Reports live in `audit_events.details`.
- Remote 3x-ui sources via `--remote ssh://...` and `--remote http://...`
  (xuihttp), plus `s-ui sync-xui` for scheduled incremental syncs. SSH uses
  host-key TOFU with a `xui_known_hosts` table; HTTP supports the 3x-ui
  login flow.
- Encrypted `xui_sync_profiles` (AES-GCM with HKDF-SHA256 from
  `config.GetSecret()`, override via `XUI_PROFILE_KEY_FILE`),
  `cmd/migration/1_7.go` schema migration, `xuiSyncJob` cron job, and the
  `/migrate-xui/schedule` UI for managing profiles.
- Best-effort historical traffic import (`client_traffics`/`outbound_traffics`
  → `stats` aggregates) and Xray routing rules import (`geosite:*`/`geoip:*`,
  block, direct) into sing-box `route.rules`/`dns.servers`. Balancers are
  reported as warnings.
- New `xui_remote` token scope required for all remote/sync endpoints;
  local `/api/import-xui*` endpoints stay under `database`/`admin`.
  `XUI_DISABLE_REMOTE=1` disables remote sources and the cron mode.

### Notes

- `test-db/` holds local 3x-ui import fixtures with real production data
  and is no longer tracked in the repository (see `.gitignore`). Tests that
  need those fixtures are skipped automatically on CI; run them locally
  with the fixtures present in `test-db/`.

## [1.5.1-beta] - 2026-05-17 - remediation hardening and UI completion

### Security

- Telegram notifications now use an async bounded queue with retry/backoff and
  audited overflow/failure events, so login and other handlers are not blocked
  by Telegram network failures.
- Telegram event payloads, audit details, change history payloads, and backup
  captions are redacted so bot tokens, proxy credentials, API tokens, and
  backup keys are not written to logs, audit, changes, or captions.
- Realtime WebSocket handshakes now enforce Origin allow-listing, per-IP
  handshake rate limits, one-time token replay rejection, ping/pong heartbeat,
  idle close, and session-rotation close-all semantics.
- `GET /api/security/audit` now has admin scope gating for API-token requests,
  endpoint rate limiting, cursor pagination, and validated `event`/`severity`
  filters.
- `POST /api/telegram/test` is admin-scoped for API-token requests and writes
  an audit event containing only success/errorClass metadata.
- Security headers middleware was added for the panel and subscription server,
  with no-store cache handling on subscription responses.
- Fresh-install admin passwords are no longer written to application logs; the
  generated password is saved once to `<dataDir>/initial-admin.txt` with
  owner-only permissions, and startup only prints the file path.
- `s-ui admin -show` no longer prints the stored password hash; it shows the
  username and reset guidance instead.
- The frontend clears cached CSRF tokens after logout, logout-all, and
  realtime session-rotation closes so the next mutating request fetches a new
  token.
- `install.sh` now downloads the release `*.sha256` file and verifies the
  Linux tarball with `sha256sum -c` before extraction.
- Added a pull-request CI workflow for Go vet/race tests and frontend
  lint/unit/build checks.
- Admin web sessions now use a SQLite-backed server-side store; the browser
  cookie contains only a signed session ID and session data lives in the local
  `sessions` table.

### Privacy and subscriptions

- Client IP history is stored with salted hashes by default, raw display is
  disabled unless explicitly opted in, and retention is handled by cron GC.
- IP limiting still starts in monitor mode; enforce mode rejects only new
  over-limit connections and does not close active sessions.
- Subscription settings from the design are now persisted and used by link,
  JSON, and Clash subscription responses. Subscription paths are validated
  against reserved prefixes, headers are sanitized centrally, and the per-IP
  subscription rate limit is configurable.
- `POST /api/rotateSubSecret` rotates per-client subscription secrets with an
  audit event. When `subSecretRequired=true`, legacy name URLs return 404.

### Telegram and observability

- Telegram egress can use validated HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy settings stored as
  secret-aware settings. Error classes are normalized to
  `unauthorized`, `chat_not_found`, `rate_limited`, `network`, or `unknown`.
- CPU hysteresis alerts, scheduled Telegram reports, and encrypted Telegram
  database backup export are implemented and remain opt-in.
- Observability history now uses bounded buckets (`2s`, `30s`, `1m`, `5m`),
  sampled by cron, with validated metric/bucket/since API parameters.
- `GET /api/logs` accepts bounded `count`, `level`, `source`, and substring
  `filter` parameters; `GET /api/version` performs a fail-soft 1h-cached
  GitHub release check.
- Database import/export now enforces a 64 MiB cap, SQLite magic validation,
  temporary staging, read-only `PRAGMA integrity_check`, and audit events.

### Frontend

- Added the realtime frontend store with websocket reconnect/degraded states
  and polling fallback.
- Added secret-aware settings fields that show `••• stored •••` and never
  submit the placeholder as a secret value.
- Added IP history modal with raw-IP masking by default and confirmation before
  showing raw IPs to admins.
- Added Telegram settings and Audit views. The Audit view uses cursor
  pagination and server-side `event`/`severity` filters.

### Packaging and CI

- Docker builds now include a `CRONET_GO_VERSION` argument synchronized with
  `release.yml` and document the dated fallback to upstream's latest prebuilt
  `libcronet` asset until commit-addressable assets are available.
- The Docker image default `TZ` now matches the panel default
  `Europe/Moscow`.
- The manual release workflow now defaults to tag `v1.5.1-beta`.
- The container entrypoint no longer runs a duplicate automatic migration
  before startup; use `SUI_MIGRATE_ONLY=1` for a manual migration-only run.
- The migration runner now performs the SQLite WAL checkpoint only after a
  successful transaction commit, fixing `database table is locked` failures
  seen during `1.4.x` to `1.5.1-beta` upgrades.
- The admin frontend no longer depends on an inline base-path script, so the
  strict Content Security Policy is honored and custom web paths route API,
  CSRF and realtime fallback requests correctly.

### Tests

- Added or extended regression coverage for secret settings migration,
  redaction, IP monitor cache/enforce behavior, audit filtering/rate limits,
  subscription header injection and 404 legacy URL behavior, realtime Origin,
  replay token and heartbeat behavior, migrations, and frontend websocket/IP
  helper behavior.
- Verification in this workspace: `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`,
  `npm run test:unit`, `npm run build`, and `npm run lint` pass. Race tests
  require CGO and a C compiler; this Windows workspace currently lacks `gcc`.

### Upgrade notes

- Back up the SQLite database before upgrading. If using the system service,
  stop `s-ui`, copy `s-ui.db` plus any `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars, then start the
  service again.
- Legacy `/apiv2/*` `Token` header support remains temporary. Move clients to
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` before the Sunset date:
  `Sat, 15 Aug 2026 00:00:00 GMT`.
- All new features remain off by default except realtime websocket support
  with frontend polling fallback and monitor-only IP tracking.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-15 - security foundation and realtime platform

### Security

- Added an Admins panel action to invalidate all admin web sessions at once.
  The action rotates the session generation and clears the initiator's current
  cookie; API tokens are not revoked.
- Added an AES-GCM/HKDF secretbox helper for sensitive settings. New
  secret-aware settings are encrypted with `SUI_SECRETBOX_KEY` when set, or
  with the legacy `settings.secret` compatibility key with a startup warning.
- Secret-aware settings are masked from `api/settings` as `<key>HasSecret`;
  saving an empty value keeps the previously stored secret.
- Added the `audit_events` table, redaction helper, retention setting, and
  `/api/security/audit` endpoint. Login, logout, logout-all-admins, credential
  changes, and API token create/delete actions now write redacted audit events.
- Added CSRF protection for browser `/api/*` mutating requests. `GET /api/csrf`
  issues a session-bound token, frontend requests send it as `X-CSRF-Token`,
  and invalid or expired tokens return HTTP 403. Bearer-token `/apiv2/*`
  requests are not affected.
- API tokens are now migrated from plaintext to salted SHA-256 hashes using
  the per-install `installSalt`; new tokens are shown only once, stored as
  hash/prefix metadata, and can be enabled or disabled from the Admins UI.
- `/apiv2/*` now accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>` as the primary API
  token transport. The legacy `Token` header still works, emits audit events,
  and returns `Deprecation` plus `Sunset: Sat, 15 Aug 2026 00:00:00 GMT`.
- Added per-client subscription secrets. New `/sub/<secret>`,
  `/sub/json/<secret>`, `/sub/clash/<secret>`, `/json/<secret>`, and
  `/clash/<secret>` routes are supported; legacy `/sub/<name>` remains enabled
  until `subSecretRequired=true`.
- Subscription endpoints now sanitize response headers, validate configured
  subscription paths, and apply a per-IP rate limit.

### API

- Added grouped API route placeholders for the `1.5.0` security,
  notification, observability, and bulk outbound-check work while preserving
  the existing one-level `/api/<action>` endpoints.
- Added `GET /api/observability/history`,
  `GET /api/observability/core-history`, and `GET /api/version`.
- Added `POST /api/checkOutbounds` for bounded bulk outbound checks with
  concurrency `8`, per-outbound timeout `5s`, total timeout `60s`, and an
  HTTPS/public-IP target validator.
- Added disabled-by-default Telegram notification service and
  `POST /api/telegram/test`. Bot token and proxy-related settings are
  secret-aware; login, logout-all-admins, and core restart events notify only
  when Telegram is explicitly enabled.
- Added authenticated realtime WebSocket foundation under
  `/api/realtime/ws-token` and `/api/realtime/ws` with one-time tokens,
  bounded client queues, per-user/per-IP connection limits, and frontend
  polling fallback. `logoutAllAdmins` closes active realtime sockets with
  close code `4401`.
- Added batched client IP monitoring with `client_ips`, per-client `limitIp`
  and `ipLimitMode`, last-online/IP-count metadata, Admins-audited clear
  action, and Clients UI controls. `monitor` is the default mode; `enforce`
  rejects only new over-limit connections and never closes active connections.

### Localization

- `install.sh` and the `s-ui` management menu now also offer Chinese as
  option **3. 中文**; `SUI_LANG=zh` is supported for non-interactive installs.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-05-15 - sing-box runtime update

This release updates the embedded sing-box runtime from `v1.13.4` to
`v1.13.11` and keeps the panel, REST API, frontend forms, and database
schema unchanged.

### Runtime

- Updated `github.com/sagernet/sing-box` to `v1.13.11`.
- Accepted the matching upstream dependency set, including `sing v0.8.9`,
  `sing-tun v0.8.9`, `sing-quic v0.6.1`, and the April 2026 `cronet-go`
  modules required by NaiveProxy.
- Pinned the Linux release workflow to the full `cronet-go` commit
  `e4926ba205fae5351e3d3eeafff7e7029654424a` so release builds do not use a
  short commit prefix for the source checkout.

### Compatibility and Security

- No database migration is required; stored inbound/outbound/endpoint/service
  JSON remains compatible with `sing-box v1.13.11`.
- No web UI fields were added because `sing-box 1.13.5` through `1.13.11`
  only contain fixes and runtime updates, including the fake-ip DNS fix,
  NaiveProxy update, and process searcher regression fix.
- Production upgrades should deploy the full release archive or rebuilt image
  so the updated `libcronet.so`/`libcronet.dll` stays in sync with the new
  binary.

### Verification

- `go mod verify`
- `go test ./...`
- `go test -tags "with_quic,with_grpc,with_utls,with_acme,with_gvisor,with_naive_outbound,with_purego,with_tailscale" ./...`

## [1.4.2-beta] — 2026-05-14 — security and reliability hardening

This release rewrites large parts of the auth, transaction, and runtime
control flow, hardens the external-subscription fetcher against SSRF,
and renames the Go module to `github.com/deposist/s-ui-x`.

The full backend test suite (`go test`, `go test -race`,
`go test -tags "with_quic,with_grpc,with_utls,with_acme,with_gvisor,with_tailscale"`)
and the full frontend pipeline (`npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`,
`npm audit --audit-level=high`) pass clean.

### Highlights

- Plaintext passwords replaced with bcrypt; existing accounts migrate
  transparently on first successful login.
- First-run admin password is randomly generated and printed once to the
  application log (no more shipped `admin/admin`).
- Login rate limiter (5 failures / 15 minutes / 15 minutes block) with
  bounded memory.
- Bilingual (English/Russian) `install.sh` and `s-ui` management menu;
  language pickable on first run, switchable from menu item **21.
  Language**, persisted in `/etc/s-ui/lang`. Default language is English.
- Default panel timezone changed from `Asia/Shanghai` to `Europe/Moscow`.
- Default frontend locale changed from Simplified Chinese to English
  (existing installations keep their saved `localStorage.locale`).
- External subscription URL fetcher rejects private/loopback/link-local
  targets and re-validates the resolved IP at dial time, blocking
  DNS-rebinding attacks.
- Configuration saves no longer leave the panel and sing-box out of sync
  on commit/start failures.
- Race-free core lifecycle, online-stats tracking, last-update
  bookkeeping, and v2 token store.
- Frontend code splitting re-enabled; `v-html` removed from the
  remaining surfaces; `AbortController` replaces deprecated
  `axios.CancelToken`.

### Breaking / behaviour changes

- **Module path**: `github.com/alireza0/s-ui` → `github.com/deposist/s-ui-x`.
  Source consumers must update imports. Pre-built binaries are unaffected.
- **Default admin password**: on a fresh database, a random 24-character
  password is generated. Look for the line
  `created initial admin user. username=admin password=...` in the
  application log on first start. **Existing databases keep their
  configured admin user**; nothing is reset.
- **`X-Forwarded-For`**: ignored unless `SUI_TRUSTED_PROXIES` lists the
  immediate client. When set, the chain is walked **right-to-left** and
  the first non-trusted hop wins. Previously the leftmost (easily
  spoofed) value was returned.
- **Login lockout**: 5 failed logins from the same client IP within 15
  minutes block that IP for 15 minutes.
- **Subscription fetcher TLS**: `InsecureSkipVerify` was removed.
  Self-signed origins must now use a certificate trusted by the system
  store.
- **Subscription fetcher private targets**: blocked by default. Set
  `SUI_ALLOW_PRIVATE_SUB_URLS=true` to opt back in (e.g. for `127.0.0.1`
  origins on the same host).
- **Sub fetcher size cap**: responses larger than 4 MiB are rejected.
- **Cookie store**: cookies are now `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and
  `Secure` when the request is HTTPS (directly or via a trusted proxy
  that sent `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`).
- **Frontend dedupe**: only `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS` requests are deduped;
  concurrent mutating requests no longer cancel each other.

### Security

| Severity | Change |
| --- | --- |
| High | Replaced plaintext password storage with bcrypt hashes (`util/common/password.go`). Existing entries are detected via the `bcrypt:` prefix or the `$2[aby]$` cost markers. |
| High | Lazy migration: a successful login with an unhashed password updates the DB record to a bcrypt hash. |
| High | Fixed `admin/admin` default removed; first-run admin password is randomly generated by `common.Random(24)` and logged once (`database/db.go.initUser`). |
| High | Login rate limiter introduced (`api/rateLimit.go`), with periodic state pruning and a hard cap of 4096 tracked keys to prevent unbounded memory growth. |
| High | Hardened session cookies with `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and HTTPS-aware `Secure` (`api/session.go`). |
| High | `X-Forwarded-For` is only consulted when `SUI_TRUSTED_PROXIES` is set; the parser now walks the chain right-to-left and returns the first non-trusted hop instead of the easily spoofed leftmost value (`api/utils.go`). |
| High | Replaced unsafe SQL string concatenation with parameterized queries in `service/config.go.GetChanges` and `service/config.go.CheckChanges`. |
| High | Static identifier allow-list inside the inbound user-fetch SQL builder (`service/inbounds.go.fetchUsersByCondition`) so future inbound types cannot become a SQL-injection vector. |
| High | Removed default TLS verification bypass for external subscription fetches (`util/subToJson.go`). |
| High | External subscription URL validation: HTTP/HTTPS only, blocks `localhost`/private/link-local/multicast/unspecified by default, opt-in via `SUI_ALLOW_PRIVATE_SUB_URLS=true`, response capped at 4 MiB. |
| High | DNS-rebinding-resistant dialer: a custom `http.Transport.DialContext` re-validates each resolved IP and dials the validated address directly, so an attacker DNS that swaps records between validation and dial cannot escape the filter. |
| Medium | Replaced `error` swallowing in `WarpService.getWarpInfo`/`RegisterWarp`/`SetWarpLicense` with explicit status-code and JSON-parse checks; replaced manual JSON formatting with `encoding/json` to avoid escaping bugs. |
| Medium | Domain validator middleware now compares case-insensitively and handles bare IPv6 hosts. |

### Reliability / data integrity

- Backup export now includes the `services` and API `tokens` tables (`database/backup.go`).
- Backup import (UI: **Backup → Restore**) now also runs the schema migrations and the post-migration adapter (`database.AdaptToCurrentVersion`) automatically. Old backups (S-UI 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3 layouts, plaintext passwords, missing `services`/`tokens` tables, missing `version` row) are upgraded to the current shape on the fly. If migration fails, the previous live database is restored and an error is returned to the panel — no half-migrated state on disk.
- Schema migrations (`cmd/migration`) now return errors instead of calling `log.Fatal`, so a bad import no longer kills the panel process; the version pin is upserted instead of expecting an existing row.
- The same migration + adaptation pipeline runs at panel start (`app.Init`), so a fresh binary on top of an existing 1.x database upgrades automatically.
- Added `database.AdaptToCurrentVersion`, an idempotent post-migration step that:
  - rehashes any plaintext passwords with bcrypt (legacy backups before this fork shipped them in clear);
  - re-applies the new `idx_stats_lookup`/`idx_changes_lookup`/`idx_clients_name` indexes;
  - bumps the `settings.version` row to the build version so the migration runner short-circuits next time.
- Database path construction uses `filepath.Join` instead of string concatenation.
- Database init creates `idx_stats_lookup`, `idx_changes_lookup`, and `idx_clients_name` indexes for the hottest queries (`database/db.go.ensureIndexes`).
- SQLite connection pool tuned: `SetMaxOpenConns(8)`, `SetMaxIdleConns(4)`, `SetConnMaxLifetime(time.Hour)`, with `_busy_timeout=10000` and `_journal_mode=WAL` already in the DSN. Avoids `SQLITE_BUSY` storms during stats inserts.
- Transaction commits in `service.config.Save`, `service.stats.SaveStats`, and `service.client.DepleteClients` are checked; a failed commit is now reported up the call chain instead of being silently dropped.
- Configuration saves only mutate sing-box runtime state **after** a successful DB commit. The previous behaviour could end with a runtime change applied but a rolled-back DB.
- User-driven core restarts (`RestartCore`) bypass the cron cooldown so the API reflects the real start status. The cron `CheckCoreJob` continues to respect the cooldown.
- Inbound restart and `GetSingboxInfo` are now nil-safe against a concurrent core stop/start (previously could panic with `nil pointer dereference` on `corePtr.GetInstance().ConnTracker()`).
- Race-detector-clean synchronization around:
  - API tokens (`api/apiV2Handler.go`, now a `map[string]TokenInMemory` with O(1) lookup).
  - Online stats (`service/stats.go.onlineResources`) — readers receive a deep copy under `RWMutex`.
  - Core running state and instance pointer (`core/main.go.Core`).
  - Last-update bookkeeping (`service/config.go.LastUpdate`).
- HTTP server now sets `ReadHeaderTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout`, and `tls.Config.MinVersion = tls.VersionTLS12` for both the panel and the subscription server.

### Frontend / tooling

- Fixed `npm ci` by syncing `package-lock.json`.
- Migrated ESLint to flat config (`frontend/eslint.config.mjs`).
- Lint script now reports without auto-fixing (`"lint": "eslint ."`).
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- Axios setup moved onto the exported instance; deprecated `CancelToken` replaced with `AbortController`. Dedupe limited to idempotent reads.
- Removed unsafe `v-html` from `Logs.vue`, `RuleImport.vue`, the IP lists in `Main.vue`, and the gauge tile (`components/tiles/Gauge.vue`).
- Fixed `enableTraffic=false` not propagating to the store, `loadClients` crashing on empty results, and the unused filtered status request list in `Main.vue.reloadData`.
- Re-enabled Vite code splitting; bundle output uses `[hash].js`/`[hash].css` filenames.

### Localization & defaults

- `install.sh` and the `s-ui` management menu are now bilingual
  (English / Russian). On first run the user is asked to pick a
  language; the choice is stored in `/etc/s-ui/lang` and reused on
  subsequent runs. `SUI_LANG=en|ru` overrides interactively or in CI.
- Added menu item **21. Language** so the user can switch UI language
  without editing files.
- Default `timeLocation` for the panel changed from `Asia/Shanghai`
  to `Europe/Moscow`.
- Default frontend locale (and Vuetify locale) changed from
  `zhHans` (Simplified Chinese) to `en`. The user-selected locale
  saved in `localStorage` is still honoured, so existing browsers
  keep their language.

### Repository / packaging

- Go module renamed to `github.com/deposist/s-ui-x`; all internal imports updated.
- `frontend/go.mod` keeps root-level `go` commands away from `frontend/node_modules`.
- README, `install.sh`, `s-ui.sh`, `docker-compose.yml` updated to point at `https://github.com/deposist/s-ui-x` and `ghcr.io/deposist/s-ui-x`.

### Tests

New regression tests:

- `util/common/password_test.go` — hashing, plaintext detection, migration flag.
- `util/subToJson_test.go` — URL validation rejects `file://`, `localhost`, RFC1918, IPv6 loopback; opt-in restores private targets.
- `util/subToJson_dial_test.go` — dialer hook rejects loopback addresses post-validation; opt-in allows them.
- `service/setting_test.go` — default port omission for `subURI`.
- `database/backup_test.go` — backup includes `services` and `tokens`.
- `database/adapt_test.go` — legacy plaintext password rehashing during import is correct, idempotent, and bumps `settings.version`.
- `api/rateLimit_test.go` — block on max failures, reset clears state, concurrent access.
- `api/utils_test.go` — XFF parsing matrix (untrusted client, rightmost untrusted hop, all-trusted fallback, spoofed XFF from untrusted client).

## Upgrade guide (English, TL;DR)

You can upgrade in place without losing data or reconfiguring the server.
The DB schema is migrated automatically on every panel start
(`app.Init` → `cmd/migration` → `database.AdaptToCurrentVersion`),
existing settings/inbounds/outbounds/clients/tokens stay intact, and
plaintext admin passwords migrate to bcrypt automatically on the next
login. Backups taken from older S-UI builds (1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3) can be
restored straight from the panel and will be brought up to the current
schema in the same flow.

1. Make a backup, just in case:
   - via panel: **Backup → Backup**, save the resulting `s-ui_*.db`;
   - or copy the file: `cp /usr/local/s-ui/db/s-ui.db /root/s-ui.db.bak`.
2. Stop the service: `systemctl stop s-ui`.
3. Replace the binary or the docker image with the new build:
   - manual: extract the new tarball into `/usr/local/s-ui/`;
   - docker: bump the image tag to `ghcr.io/deposist/s-ui-x` and `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
4. Start the service: `systemctl start s-ui`.
5. Log in as usual. Your password is stored in plaintext today; the
   panel hashes it transparently on first successful login.

What you should review after the upgrade:

- If the panel sits behind a reverse proxy and you relied on
  `X-Forwarded-For` (e.g. for IP audit logs), set
  `SUI_TRUSTED_PROXIES=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16,…` to the CIDRs your
  proxy lives in. Without this variable, XFF is ignored and audit logs
  show the proxy IP instead of the real client.
- If you fetch external subscriptions from a private endpoint
  (`http://127.0.0.1:…/sub` etc.), set `SUI_ALLOW_PRIVATE_SUB_URLS=true`.
- If you used the old install / update script (`deposist/s-ui`), grab
  the new one once: `wget -O /usr/bin/s-ui https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deposist/s-ui-x/main/s-ui.sh && chmod +x /usr/bin/s-ui`.

## Rollback

If something goes wrong, restoring your backup is enough:

1. `systemctl stop s-ui`.
2. `cp /root/s-ui.db.bak /usr/local/s-ui/db/s-ui.db`.
3. Either restore the previous binary or `docker compose` to the
   previous image tag.
4. `systemctl start s-ui`.

The bcrypt prefix in the `users.password` column is forward- and
backward-compatible with the old binary in the sense that the old binary
will simply not match a hashed password, in which case `s-ui admin -reset`
restores a known credential. So data is safe; only the admin password
might need a CLI reset on rollback.
